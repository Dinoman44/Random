# quad_ec.py
This program is useful for finding the roots of a quadratic equation, and if possible its vertex. A quadratic equation is in the form: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`
The program takes the coefficients a,b and c as input, and uses the quadratic formula to calculate possible values of x:
`x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) รท 2a`
If it has real roots, the program can also calculate the vertex of the curve(its lowest or highest point)
